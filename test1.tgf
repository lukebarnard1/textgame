So here it is, the first version of my text-based game engine.
It has very simple rules currently and I will keep adding more as I go along.
So far, you can jump to other lines of the input file through decisions which are signified by inserting a tab character at the beginning of a line. That line then becomes the first option and following line starting with tab also become options.
Options are spcecified like this: "[tab] n command", where "[tab]" is the tab character, n is a line number in the game file (can be above or below the decision point) and "command" is the text that the player has to type in to jump to the line specified.
I am hoping to add nested features in the future because it would allow for more complicated game play.
I also like the idea of maintaining some sort of inventory. But anyway. Here goes the first game.
